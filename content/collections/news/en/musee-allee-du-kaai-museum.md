    text: '<p>Due to the current situation we’ve decided to cancel our colloquium on the 12th of January. But we will launch our new book. No matter what.&nbsp;How? We’ll open the 12th a museum for one day. For us, the temporary character of our projects is synonymous with flexibility. We adapt the space to&nbsp;ever-changing&nbsp;needs, we experiment with new forms.&nbsp; Experimentation is in the DNA of&nbsp;Allee Du Kaai. So, we&nbsp;decided to transform the space into a museum for one day. You can pass by, discover it by yourself our you can book a guided tour to get more explanation. And that’s not all, you can leave with our brand new book (free donation) about Allee Du Kaai in your hands.</p><p>You can book a time slot&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/F2wPrpSCdZ75tBLL6">here</a>.</p>'

    text: '<h2>About the book</h2><blockquote><h4>A book about Allee Du Kaai,&nbsp;</h4><h4>that temporary project in the North of Brussels</h4><h4>between Havenlaan and Materialenkaai.&nbsp;</h4></blockquote><p>Our first book “Leegstond”&nbsp;combined&nbsp;our practical experience with the results of four years of intensive research into vacant spaces throughout Belgium. This book is a practical guide for those who want to temporarily occupy an empty building.*</p><p>Our book "Allee Du Kaai" brings together our experiences in a particular neighborhood undergoing a mega-transformation, shares our successes and failures and asks questions about our role in the city.</p><p>Everyone can find something interesting in this book. Those who have never been here before can join a guided tour, urbanists and architects can learn from our work on the site, our peers, partners and volunteers can get lost in a nostalgic trip through all the photos and politicians can take inspiration from this manifesto for an alternative in the city, a plea for free havens.</p><p>Some themes we discuss:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How to build an alternative city?</li><li>Who are the players on Allee Du Kaai?</li><li>Why do we turn a blind eye now and then?</li><li>Why do something the easy way when it can be done the hard way?</li><li>Are there limits to temporality?</li><li>What legacy will Allee Du Kaai leave behind?</li></ul><p>We have invested with a whole community for the last 7 years. 9000 m2 that is a work of many hands and hearts. For the book this is no different.</p><p>YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO COME AND DISCOVER THE BOOK AND THE SPACES OF ALLEE DU KAAI ON WEDNESDAY 12/1/2022.</p>'
