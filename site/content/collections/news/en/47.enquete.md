For this survey, we are looking for recent testimonials from the past three years.&nbsp;</p><p>At the next general meeting, we will work with the results.Fill in the survey right away, itâ€™s anonymous and takes around 6 minutes to complete.<a href="https://forms.gle/LB1GhvbPTAHZTNkd8?fbclid=IwAR1ED8grwVmX8omRAZPvc-24HHopa-YZqB0TtGQk36Llvy-3joTl0dCQvT8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/LB1GhvbPTAHZTNkd8</a><br></p>'
