    text: '<h2>Allee du Kaai</h2><p>Located next to Brussels Canal, not far from the centre, you will find the all-in formula for a summer in Brussels.&nbsp;Allee du Kaai is the meeting place where you should definitely pass by. For some it is a studio, for others a skate park, a graffiti mecca, a picnic spot or a place to do some spontaneous gardening. And what’s more: it''s the last summer we can enjoy our beloved Pelouse. So, a reason more to plan a visit. &nbsp;</p><p>Every Wednesday and Saturday we provide a surprising package of activities. Everyone is welcome! All you need to bring is your good mood and some sun cream!&nbsp;</p><p>In short, Allee du Kaai is a lively place where a variety of social, artistic and sporting activities take place.&nbsp;</p>'
