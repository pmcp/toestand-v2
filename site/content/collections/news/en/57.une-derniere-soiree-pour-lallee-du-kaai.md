      <p>A final celebration for Allee du Kaai
      On Februari 25, Allee du Kaai opened its doors to the general public for one very last time. More than 2000 party people were present to celebrate a this mythical place of the Brussels capital. We welcomed many artists who made the walls of Allee Du Kaai vibrate to the rhythm of the music. 
      
      The turnout was overwhelming, resulting in a long queue. We would like to apologize to everyone who did not get in. A coffee table was also held the next morning. With this festive weekend we closed the doors of our beloved Kaai for good after 9 wonderful years. We would like to thank all our partners, volunteers, visitors and environment Brussels for their contribution to this project.</p><p><br></p>
