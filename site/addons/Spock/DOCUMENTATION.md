## Installation

1. Copy the `addons/Spock` directory into `site/addons`.
2. Whitelist the environments Spock should be run in. [Read more.](#whitelisting-environments)

## Commands

Out of the box, Spock will perform a few git commands to stage, commit, and push any affected files.

Basically, it will do this:

``` bash
# Any `commands_before` will be run here
# ...

# Each affected file will be staged in a separate command
git add modified_file.md
git add another_modified_file.md
git add deleted_file.md

git commit -m "Data saved by bob"  # or Fieldset saved, Asset uploaded, etc...

git push  # this is opt-in

# Any `commands_after` will be run here
# ...
```

You may enable `git push`-ing in your `spock.yaml`.

``` yaml
git_push: true
```

You may add hardcoded commands before or after the git commands by adding `commands_before` and/or `commands_after` to your `spock.yaml`:

``` yaml
commands_before:
  - some-unix-command
commands_after:
  - another-unix-command
```

## Naming Spock's Commits

By default, Spock will commit via the username and email configured in Git (which is usually you).

You can override this by editing the "Git Username" and/or "Git Email" fields in the Spock addon settings area of the Control Panel, or add the variables to your `site/settings/addons/spock.yaml`, for example:

``` yaml
git_username: Spock
git_email: spock@domain.com
```


## Custom commands

The Git workflow Spock provides out of the box works fine for most people, but if you have special requirements, you may define your own set of commands. You can do this in a service provider like so:

``` php
class YourServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        // As a string, for a single command:
        app('spock')->setCommands('some-command');

        // As an array for basic commands:
        app('spock')->setCommands(['command one', 'command two']);

        // A closure that returns an array of commands.
        // The first argument will be an instance of the `Commander` class.
        app('spock')->setCommands(function ($spock) {
            $paths = $spock->event()->affectedPaths();
            //
            return [ ];
        });
    }
}
```

## Whitelisting Environments

Spock will only run commands when it's in a whitelisted environment. By default, Spock will only run in the `production` environment.

You can edit the environments in Spock addon settings area of the Control Panel, or add an `environments` array to `site/settings/addons/spock.yaml`, for example:

``` yaml
environments:
  - production
  - staging
```

## Queueing Commands

Spock automatically queues commands to run in the background when you have a queue driver set.  This can be helpful if you have git set to automatically push, or if you are running any commands that take time to execute, causing your users to experience wait time.  To setup a queue in your statamic app:

1. Ensure [Redis](https://redis.io/) is installed and running on your server.
2. Add `QUEUE_DRIVER=redis` to your `.env` file. [Whatâ€™s an .env file?](https://docs.statamic.com/environments)
3. Run `php please queue:listen`.
